usus : User Setup, Utter Showoff
================================

Pretty much a shell version of [`archey`](https://github.com/djmelik/archey), not quite as complete yet. Requires [`lwcat`](https://github.com/altaris/lwcat), and works better with [`lolcat`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/saucy/man6/lolcat.6.html) !
